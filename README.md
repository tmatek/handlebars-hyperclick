# Handlebars Hyperclick

A plugin for [Atom's Hyperclick package](https://github.com/facebook-atom/hyperclick) to support Handlebars partials.

By default, the current project root directory is used as the partials directory. You can change this by specifying `"hbsPartialsDir": "./my-partials-dir"` in `package.json`.
